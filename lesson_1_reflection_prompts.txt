How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It exactly outlined or pinpointed the lines where there were differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It becomes easier to make changes to your files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros- it helps to immediately save changes and also details what changes u made. Good for saving code.

Cons- there is no automatic method to save your versions. so, you need to use proper judgement.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   more efficient.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log
   git diff first id second id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git check out

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   save different versions of code.
